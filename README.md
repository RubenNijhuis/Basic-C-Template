## Notes

#### Submodules:
This project uses my personal libraries, in case you want to use your own I recommend learning some stuff about git submodules [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

#### Opnionated:
This project is structure in a way that I prefer working with. It's a mix of working in JavaScript projects and some other languages where folder structure dictates code relation. If you have improvements or other comments you can open an issue.

#### Program creation
Due to the way the makefile is made you have to explicitely name each file in your makefile. (this will change in an update soon btw). Furthermore `.o` files are put in a `objs/` folder to keep the `src/` clean.

## Structure
```
/- Basic-C-Template
    /- assets
        # Any assets like images or text files can be put here
    /- include
        # files like .a or .h can be put here
    /- libs
        # included libraries like libft or get_next_line are put here
    /- src
        # your project files can be ordered here
    .gitignore # i really shouldn't have to explain this
    LICENS # mit licens for license reasons
    Makefile # magic happens here
    README.md # the file that contains what you are currently reading
```
